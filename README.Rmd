# Hello World ;)  

**AmodeoAdvising/AmodeoAdvising** is a âœ¨ _very special_ âœ¨ repository because it's where we e-meet!  

I'm R A Amodeo (they/she), born scientist and trained econometrician.  

Welcome to my GitHub profile.  

**Let's work together.**  
Browse my public repos and reach out via [email](mailto:rebeccaaamodeo@gmail.com) to learn what being on my client list can do for you.   

Here are some ideas to get you started:  

- Increase profits with an audit report on process improvements and available cost efficiencies.  

- Secure investment funding with sophisticated data visualizations of past and predicted performance.     

- Save time with custom reports and dashboards.   

- Document business practices, goals, strategies, and plans for coherent representation of your organization to investors, bankers, and community partners.    

- Onboard new teammates well with a company handbook including clear procedure notes.    

**A little more about me**  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a big fan of sky events and love to look up every chance I get.  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of GitHub Pro advanced options and how to care for a range of houseplants that have no business surviving in the PNW.  

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m collaborating with [Samuel Sinyangwe](https://twitter.com/samswey) tracking and analyzing data on police shootings and other activity in the U.S.A. Find the Police Scorecard project [here](https://policescorecard.org).  

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help finding my next position, one that provides significant intellectual stimulation and includes predictive modeling and causal inference.    

- ðŸ’¬ Talk nerdy to me about Star Trek canon, R and RStudio, crime economics, and process improvement.     

- ðŸ“« Learn about supporting survivors of domestic abuse with letter-writing campaigns from [Survived and Punished](https://survivedandpunished.org/letter-writing-action/).  

- ðŸ˜„ I always smile when I buy or use Post-It flags, when I listen to *Hit or Miss* by Odetta (YouTube vid [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENzLb85b1Do)), and when I randomly remember that time 5-year-old me mistook a mincemeat pie for blueberry.   

- âš¡ Fun fact: Many with impostor syndrome are *correct*. -- we are breaking down barriers in spaces made to exclude us. Moral of the story? Embrace the impostor syndrome and be proud you're unseating the status quo!
